# jsdoc folder
This folder is for jsdoc generated comments from within my javascript
files. The html files will open in your local webserver. You will offcourse
need to have jsdoc installed on your computer.
To generate docs you can use terminal command:<br/>
jsdoc **filename** --destination **path**<br/>
Example, with my folder structure if the command prompt is in "js" folder:<br/>
jsdoc index.js --destination ../../jsdoc
