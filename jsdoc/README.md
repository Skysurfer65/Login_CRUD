# jsdoc folder
This folder is for jsdoc generated comments from within my javascript
files. The html files will open in your local webserver. To generate docs you can use 
terminal command, you will of course need to have jsdoc installed on your computer:<br/>
jsdoc **filename** --destination **path**<br/>
Example, with my folder structure if the command prompt is in "js" folder:<br/>
jsdoc index.js --destination ../../jsdoc
