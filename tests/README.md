# Unit tests with Jest
Testing classUser functions:
- validateUserID()
- validatePassword()
- checkUserInDB()
- checkPassword()

# TODO's
Jest was installed in tests folder which doesn't generate html
printout for coverage. This is because tested files are in different folder.
Reinstall to put package.json file in top folder.
